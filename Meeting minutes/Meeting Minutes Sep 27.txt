Meeting Minutes Sep 27
With Albert

- Dashboard -> the end of project or not? -> data collection + data management, aka decision support system -> 2 fundamental premises:

1. Management by objective (dashboard, sales)
2. Performance based compensation -> need actual event -> measurements will decided by the company

Capture, manage, integrate real data -> allow changes in the system (ppl quit, adjust KPI, ) -> decentralized system (company has diff locations)

Compensation MUST BE calculated accurately!!! 

This project = consulting. Need to learn quickly the client's culture, processing data

Limit of Excel (current practice)
- Automatic extraction, maintenance, real-time calculation, etc.

What kind of data they need to extract, how to validate accuracy of report, time period to extract data?

Extract data from the system Jane -> store in the database -> extract data monthly, report by getting monthly data performance vs plan by category, revenue,...

- Secure, protected and usable over time, user-friendly interface. MUST BE transparent as well.
- Open sourced, robust, free database software -> Apache Pinot, PostgreSQL, Superset Apache...
- Strategic imperative -> hierarchical format
- Extracted data must 
- DigitalFile company works w SpringBoard for Desktop support, no internal IT team
- Healthcheck
- The plan: the intention of the company or what they want to see in the report, questions, group's incentive or individual's incentive

- Bi-weekly meeting with client

- Vincent suggests Excel to make Dashboard or Django (python language) since they're free
- Vincent breaks down to 3 tasks: Extract data -> how to keep the data -> how to transform the data into dashboard
- Might need a lot of issues when launch so need to finish asap

------------------------------------------
Below is from Albert email:

The development of a system to enter and edit plan data over time, i..e, multiple year. It is not just an Excel worksheet
The development of a system to extract and summarize actual data from the production system to capture actual data
A data integration module and dashboard to integrate the actual versus plan data
 
All of these cannot be done through an Excel worksheet. I suggest that the students spend some time thinking through this problem and put together a concept paper as a starting point. This paper should include a system chart etc. Once the paper is put together, we can get the client to review it and agree to it before the actual development.


This project also include the choice of the appropriate technology for data capture, capture management, reporting, and visualization.

Let me know if you have further questions. I can meet with the students next Thursday or Friday if necessary.
